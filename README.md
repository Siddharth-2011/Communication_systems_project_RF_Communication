**RF Communication Project - Transmitter and Receiver**
This repository contains a hardware project that demonstrates RF communication between two devices using a 433MHz RF module. The project includes a transmitter and a receiver, both of which are implemented using the Arduino Uno microcontroller.
**Project Overview**
RF (Radio Frequency) communication enables wireless transmission of information through the use of electromagnetic signals at radio frequencies. This technology finds applications in various fields such as television and radio broadcasting, wireless networking, cellular communication, and satellite communication.
In RF communication, information is encoded onto a high-frequency carrier wave, which is transmitted through the air using antennas. The receiver then decodes the information from the received signal, allowing for the exchange of data between the devices.
The RF communication project in this repository focuses on establishing wireless communication between two devices using a 433MHz RF module. This module enables the transmission and reception of data over a short distance.
**Hardware Components**
The project utilizes the following hardware components:
**Arduino Uno:** The Arduino Uno microcontroller serves as the central processing unit for both the transmitter and the receiver. It provides the necessary interfaces and functionalities for implementing the RF communication.
**433MHz RF Module:** The 433MHz RF module is used for wireless communication between the transmitter and receiver. It facilitates the transmission and reception of data signals.

**Repository Structure**
The repository is structured as follows:
/ECE321_project_receiver.ino: This directory contains the Arduino IDE code for the receiver module of the RF communication.
/ECE321_project_transmitter.ino: This directory contains the Arduino IDE code for the transmitter module of the RF communication.
/proteus design: This directory contains the proteus design of the RF commmunication between two devices.

**Getting Started**
To set up and use the RF communication project, follow these steps:
1. Review the documentation in the /report final directory to understand the project's setup, circuit diagrams, and the principles of RF communication.
2. Connect the 433MHz RF module to the Arduino Uno for both the transmitter and receiver devices, following the provided instructions.
3. Upload the code from the /ECE321_project_transmitter directory to the Arduino Uno connected to the transmitter device.
4. Upload the code from the /ECE321_project_receiver directory to the Arduino Uno connected to the receiver device.
5. Power on both devices and verify the RF communication by transmitting data from the transmitter and receiving it on the receiver.
6. Customize and modify the code, circuit connections, or RF communication parameters as desired to explore different aspects of RF communication.

Enjoy exploring the possibilities of RF communication and the capabilities of the 433MHz RF module in establishing wireless connectivity between devices!
